## Coffee Collection Migrations

You're making an API that can list, create, read, update, and delete a collection of coffee. The app is complete, but is missing database migrations. Create a table called `coffee` with the following columns:

* **`id`**: Auto-incrementing Integer
* **`name`**: String
* **`roaster`**: String
* **`aroma`**: Integer

Don't forget to reverse this for rollbacks.
